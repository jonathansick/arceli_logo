## Logo treatments

### futura_arceli_logo.ai

This treatment uses PT Futura Heavy with the RSS logo.

### corner_store_logo.ai

This treatment uses [Corner Store](http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Corner-Store-JBT0000111?skeywords=corner%20store) by Jukebox.
I've modified the outlined font to include a ligature between the 'A' and 'r'.
I've also setup an option vector dropshow treatment.

### arceli_baseball_circle.ai

This is the baseball logo. Darn Americans and their baseball tainting a good design. :)

Here the Corner Store A is stretch to wrap around the circle. Arcs evoke the RSS logo, and the arce.li domain makes up the outermost arc.

### arceli_corner_store_icon.ai

This uses the Corner store baseball-like swash in a simpler design.

### arceli_antenna.ai

This is a treatment that attempts to backtrack from the baseball look, while keeping the RSS symbolism. This really needs an inner circle arc to look right.
