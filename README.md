# Arceli's Logo

Illustrator files and pngs are stored with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).
Ask me about fonts if you intend to use the Illustrator files.

# corner_store_logo.ai

This treatment uses [Corner Store](http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Corner-Store-JBT0000111?skeywords=corner%20store) by Jukebox.
I've modified the outlined font to include a ligature between the 'A' and 'r'.
I've also setup an option vector dropshow treatment.
